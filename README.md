Here's a draft `README.md` file tailored for your "Polyrhythm Visualization" project:

# Polyrhythm Visualization

A creative and interactive visualization of polyrhythms using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, with integrated sound generation. The project showcases balls moving along circular tracks at different speeds, playing tones as they cross specific thresholds.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tracks and Balls**: Multiple concentric tracks and moving balls with adjustable speed and radius.
- **Sound Integration**: Generates sounds using the Web Audio API, synchronized with ball movements.
- **Customizable Visualization**: Easily tweak parameters such as track count, ball speed, and sound frequencies.

## Demo

[Live Demo](#) (Add a link to a hosted version of your project or a GIF showcasing the animation)

## How It Works

1. **Tracks**: Concentric circles that act as paths for the balls.
2. **Balls**: Move along their respective tracks at varying speeds and play tones when they meet specific conditions.
3. **Sound**: Generated using oscillators with customizable frequencies and durations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/polyrhythm-visualization.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the project.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with the Canvas setup and animation loop.
- `sound.js`: Contains functions for generating sound using the Web Audio API.
- `track.js`: Implements the `Track` class for managing the circular paths.
- `ball.js`: Implements the `Ball` class for animating the balls and triggering sounds.

## Customization

You can modify the following parameters in `index.html`:

- `N`: Number of tracks and balls.
- `trackStep`: Distance between consecutive tracks.
- `ballSpeed`: Base speed of the balls.
- `soundFrequencies`: Frequencies of the tones generated by the balls.

Example:
```javascript
const N = 10; // Number of tracks and balls
const trackStep = 20; // Distance between tracks
const ballSpeed = 0.05; // Base speed of balls
const soundFrequencies = [1760, 1567.98, 1318.51, 1046.5]; // Custom frequencies
```

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies. Built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex polyrhythms.
- Implement user controls to modify parameters in real-time.
- Provide visual/audio feedback for synchronization points.
